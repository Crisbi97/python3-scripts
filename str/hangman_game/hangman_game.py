Title:
Hangman Game

Description:
Create a text-based Hangman game where the program chooses a random word, and the player needs to guess the letters to complete the word.
The game provides a limited number of attempts, and the player wins if they correctly guess all the letters before running out of attempts.

Details:
1. Choose a word list: Create a list of words that will be used as potential choices for the game. These can be predefined words or loaded from a text file.
2. Select a random word: Randomly select a word from the word list to be the target word that the player needs to guess.
3. Display the initial state: Show the player the number of letters in the target word represented by underscores. For example, if the target word is "apple", display "_ _ _ _ _" to indicate that the word has five letters.
4. Set the number of attempts: Determine the maximum number of incorrect guesses the player is allowed before losing the game. This can be a fixed number or configurable.
5. Accept player guesses: Prompt the player to enter a letter as their guess. Accept input and validate that it is a single letter. Handle both uppercase and lowercase input.
6. Check the guess: Compare the player's guess to the letters in the target word. Update the display to reveal any correctly guessed letters in their correct positions.
7. Track incorrect attempts: Maintain a count of the incorrect guesses made by the player. Display the remaining attempts.
8. Handle game end conditions: Determine the conditions for winning or losing the game. If the player guesses all the letters correctly before running out of attempts, they win. If the number of incorrect guesses reaches the maximum allowed, they lose.
9. Play again option: After the game ends, give the player the option to play again if they choose to continue.

Enhancements:
Consider adding additional features such as displaying a visual representation of the hangman, providing hints, or implementing difficulty levels.
